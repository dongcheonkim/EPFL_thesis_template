Diffractive optical elements (DOEs) are used in a wide variety of applications.
\section*{Motivation}
This thesis aims to design, build and optimize DOEs operating in more complex diffraction regimes than scalar paraxial theory, with a view to obtaining higher performance components (improved diffraction efficiency, larger diffraction angles,etc) and in this way address applications which are for the moment inaccessible.
\section*{Outline of thesis}
With respect to the content of this PhD research, the thesis will be organized as follows.

@article{Fienup1982,
abstract = {Iterative algorithms for phase retrieval from intensity data are compared to gradient search methods. Both the problem of phase retrieval from two intensity measurements (in electron microscopy or wave front sensing) and the problem of phase retrieval from a single intensity measurement plus a non-negativity constraint (in astronomy) are considered, with emphasis on the latter. It is shown that both the error-reduction algorithm for the problem of a single intensity measurement and the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm for the problem of two intensity measurements converge. The error-reduction algorithm is also shown to be closely related to the steepest-descent method. Other algorithms, including the input–output algorithm and the conjugate-gradient method, are shown to converge in practice much faster than the error-reduction algorithm. Examples are shown.},

@article{Wyrowski1988,
abstract = {In the generation of computer-generated holograms the phase is in many applications a free parameter that can be manipulated to achieve a high diffraction efficiency, a small space-bandwidth product, and a speckle-free recon- struction. An iterative algorithm to determine such phase distributions is described. Experimental verifications are given.},
